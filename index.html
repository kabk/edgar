  <h1>1.1 The world changing words</h1>

  <p>We live in a society where most people know and more importantly are interested in the technological and scientific advancements around them. Millions of people watched the Rosetta-Philae comet landing  on the 12th of November 2014 and during the latest iPhone 6 unveiling in September 2014, the number of people interested in seeing the new technology showcased live was so high, that Apple?s servers crashed and were down for the better part of the event.  It has become interesting and easy to follow these types of news and events, as the topics and terminology they cover have become such a prominent part of our lives. We know what a spaceship is, we know what a robot is and we know what the Internet is. We don?t need to describe them or add a picture. But while it is easy to talk about these elements now, when they were conceived, the authors had a lot of trouble trying to explain them. 
There isn?t a definitive answer, to what the first real piece of science fiction literature was, but many people including astronomer Carl Sagan and writer Isaac Asimov have referenced ?The Dream? written by German mathematician and astronomer Johannes Kepler in 1608 as one of the first. In his novel Kepler describes travel to the Moon with the help of magic, witchcraft and demons. He used these elements as a way to treat what could not yet be explained. Soon after, in 1610, Kepler wrote to Galileo Galilei describing human ambition and imagination to explore: ?As soon as somebody demonstrates the art of flying, settlers from our species of man will not be lacking on the Moon and Jupiter. ? Who would have believed that a huge ocean could be crossed more peacefully and safely than the narrow expanse of the Adriatic, the Baltic Sea or the English Channel? Provide ship or sails adapted to the heavenly breezes, and there will be some who will not fear even that void of space. ? So, for those who will come shortly to attempt this journey, let us establish the astronomy: Galileo, you of Jupiter, I of the Moon.?    In 1865 Jules Verne treats space travel as an engineering problem in his novel ?From the Earth to the Moon?. He notes the pull of gravity near planets in space, the lack of air and weightlessness. He does this without using the word spaceship. Only in 1894 was the word spaceship first used in writing by John Jacob Astor the IVth in his novel ?A Journey in Other Worlds?, much after the idea of space travel came to be and ways before any actual space travel. This same pattern has been true for most significant scientific advancements, from H.G.Wells 1870 novel ?Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea? where similarities have been drawn to a modern lead-acid battery powered electric submarine to the prediction of the Internet by Mark Twain in his 1904 science fiction story ?From the London Times? where an invention called the ?telelectroscope? is used for worldwide information sharing. 
Many of the world changing technologies and advancements have come from times when even authors themselves couldn?t at first describe what they were trying to imagine into words. But they laid a foundation for future generations to build and evolve their ideas. And while space travel has been one of the core ideas behind science fiction for over half a century, freeing people?s imaginations and giving us men like Yuri Gagarin and the Apollo 11 crew, it has lost some of its appeal in the latest generations. People have moved from looking up at the stars to looking down on their screens and keyboards. This has led us to being more closed and individual, often finding a way of incorporating an interface between us and our subject.

  <h1>1.2 Interface</h1>

  <p>While the origin of the word ?interface? does not have a relation to science fiction, it was coined around the same time and soon became a very influential scientific term. The word ?interface? was formulated by Jatmes Thompson Bottomley in his 1882 book ?Hydrostatics?. In it he describes the various states of liquidity and viscosity as ?A perfect fluid may be defined as a body, the contiguous parts of which exert pressure upon each other perpendicular to the interface which separates them at the interface.?   He further defines&hellip;</p>
