  <h3 id="11">1.1 The world changing words</h3>
  <p>
  
  We live in a society where most people know and more importantly are interested in the technological and scientific advancements around them. Millions of people watched the Rosetta-Philae comet landing <a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"> </a>  on the 12th of November 2014 and during the latest iPhone 6 unveiling in September 2014, the number of people interested in seeing the new technology showcased live was so high, that Apple's servers crashed and were down for the better part of the event. <a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"> </a> It has become interesting and easy to follow these types of news and events, as the topics and terminology they cover have become such a prominent part of our lives. We know what a spaceship is, we know what a robot is and we know what the Internet is. We don't need to describe them or add a picture. But while it is easy to talk about these elements now, when they were conceived, the authors had a lot of trouble trying to explain them.
  </p>
  
  <p>
There is no definitive answer to what the first real piece of science fiction literature was, but many people including astronomer Carl Sagan and writer Isaac Asimov have referenced <a href="#test-popup"  class="open-popup-link">"The Dream"</a> written by German mathematician and astronomer Johannes Kepler in 1608 as one of the first. In his novel Kepler describes travel to the Moon with the help of magic, witchcraft and demons. He used these elements as a way to treat what could not yet be explained. Soon after, in 1610, Kepler wrote to Galileo Galilei describing human ambition and imagination to explore: "As soon as somebody demonstrates the art of flying, settlers from our species of man will not be lacking on the Moon and Jupiter. &hellip; Who would have believed that a huge ocean could be crossed more peacefully and safely than the narrow expanse of the Adriatic, the Baltic Sea or the English Channel? Provide ship or sails adapted to the heavenly breezes, and there will be some who will not fear even that void of space. &hellip; So, for those who will come shortly to attempt this journey, let us establish the astronomy: Galileo, you of Jupiter, I of the Moon."  <a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote"> </a> In 1865 Jules Verne treats space travel as an engineering problem in his novel "From the Earth to the Moon". He notes the pull of gravity near planets in space, the lack of air and weightlessness. He does this without using the word spaceship. Only in 1894 was the word spaceship first used in writing by John Jacob Astor the IVth in his novel <a href="#test-popup2"  class="open-popup-link">"A Journey in Other Worlds"</a>, much after the idea of space travel came to be and decades before any actual space travel. This same pattern has been true for most significant scientific advancements, from H.G.Wells 1870 novel "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea" where similarities have been drawn to a modern lead-acid battery powered electric submarine to the prediction of the Internet by Mark Twain in his 1904 science fiction story "From the London Times" where an invention called the "telelectroscope" is used for worldwide information sharing. </p> 

<p>
Many of the world changing technologies and advancements have come from times when even authors themselves couldn't at first describe what they were trying to imagine into words. But they laid a foundation for future generations to build and evolve their ideas. And while space travel has been one of the core ideas behind science fiction for over half a century, freeing people's imaginations and giving us men like Yuri Gagarin and the Apollo 11 crew, it has lost some of its appeal in the latest generations. People have moved from looking up at the stars to looking down on their screens and keyboards. This has led us to being more closed and individual, often finding a way of incorporating an interface between us and our subject.
</p>


  <h3 id="12">1.2 The Origin and Evolution of the word "Interface"</h3>

  <p>While the origin of the word "interface" does not have a straight relation to science fiction, it was coined around the same time as many of the earlier science fiction stories and soon became a very influential scientific term. The word "interface" was formulated by James Thompson Bottomley in his 1882 book "Hydrostatics". In it he describes the various states of liquidity and viscosity "A perfect fluid may be defined as a body, the contiguous parts of which exert pressure upon each other perpendicular to the interface which separates them at the interface." <a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote"> </a>
  
   </p>
  
  <p>
In its earliest form then the word "interface" referred to the moment where exchanging of materiality occurred. Only in early 1960s did the word find usage as a verb to describe the relation and exchange of information between two entities. This was brought on by the term being referenced in computer science by Marshall McLuhan. During this period it went through multiple descriptions of representing both form and content. 

 </p>
  
  <p>
In his book "The Mobile Interface of Everyday Life" <a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote"> </a>  Jason Farman describes an "interface" through the example of a mobile device. He says that a mobile device cannot be considered an interface even though it is the link between the user and the content on the screen. Rather the mobile device is simply a part of an overall interface that constitutes for the larger set of social relations. He claims that the transformation to an interface comes from how we use the mobile device, be it to receive or make phone calls, exchange data and even the activities that happen without human interaction such as charging the device itself. By his definition the interface is then the arrangement and function of these actions on a medium. But to define it and simplify it further many metaphors have been put in place to explain the interaction with the interface. In computer terms we often call them elements such as gateways, doorways or windows and by doing so we muddy the description of what an interface is and what it does.
 </p>
  
  <p>
Alexander R. Galloway says that because of the way people metaphorise many of the mediums they interact with, the word "interface" has become synonymous with media itself. <a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote"> </a> By doing so we consider frames or containers of content themselves as interfaces. Users might see a television as an interface or an ATM screen. And while these metaphors of doorways and windows were helpful in introducing the interfaces to many of its users and explained a part of the interaction during its conception, they have stuck around for too long. We should not consider the interface and mediums as one and the same. 
 </p>
  
  <p>
An "interface" can be defined by multiple perspectives. Brenda Laurel a video game designer defined the interface as a surface where the necessary contact between interactors and tasks allowed functions to be performed while Norman Long a sociologist researching social interface theory describes it as a critical point of interaction between life worlds. The understanding of the word interface is then considered a general one but can be defined in the settlement of the Human - Computer Interface as the way, the context and the content of reading through engagement.
</p>
  
  <h3 id="13">1.3 Interface in the context of science fiction</h3>
  <p>The "interface" is in essence a very generic and general term, but this can be narrowed down by defining the context in which it is used. Even in the field of computer science an "interface" can refer to multiple occasions and actions, but I will be focusing on the interface of human-computer interaction. This refers to the way we already interact with the computer. The keyboard, mouse, screen, and speakers - they are all ways of interacting with the computer underneath our desks or in our hands. And while some science fiction elements I will be researching go beyond physical, my main focus will be on interface aspects that are visual, describable or audible.</p>

  <h2></h2>
  
  <h3 id="21">2.1 Push to exit spaceship</h3>
  <p>In Georges Méliès 1902 silent film "Le Voyage dans la Lune" as the space capsule has crashed on the moon, the people in it push the door open to exit their shuttle. A spaceships door or hatch is a key part of the interaction between the astronauts and the empty void around their shuttle. It is the interface between them in a claustrophobic capsule and their exit from there. As such Nathan Shedroff brings out an interesting moment in his book "MAKE IT SO Interaction Design Lessons from Science Fiction" of Georges Méliès movie that the door of their space capsule has no lever, no button or handle. The door is simply pushed apart. <a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote"> </a> While the movie itself is not an exemplary work of science theory, the exiting of the shuttle without interacting with the door besides pushing it shows the mentality of the time this movie was made in. With the advancements of mechanisms in to the 1920s it is clear why 1927 Metropolis was a huge contrast to Méliès movie and featured an enormous array of levers, knobs, switches and dials. Shedroff thinks this could be contributed by the war times prior and ongoing, as many of the soldiers who spent long periods of time in the lever filled war scenarios, be it war rooms, tanks, submarines or planes, became accustomed to those as a way of manipulating, at the time, state of the art technology. When finalizing their service and going back home, they would take those images of wall filled levers and switches with them and as cinema consumers expect it from science fiction visuals portraying the future technologies. This clearly shows an introduction in the development of science fiction visuals from the designers perspective as the futuristic elements used in the film had to have strong references to the period of release for the viewers to make sense of what they were seeing. The trend was that the more buttons and controls were on a board, the more possibilities it produced making it futuristic and exciting. One of the first real attempts at making a purposeful interface, a step away from the fiction side and towards the more scientific, came in the 1950 movie "Destination Moon", where instead of filling a wall with extensive meaningless buttons, Robert Heinlein a science fiction writer was asked to collaborate with making the movie and provide input to make the interface for the astronaut that would mimic a real interface. Each gauge had a reason and each button a purpose.  </p>
  
  <p>
 
While anything that has the function of switching something on or off can be labeled a button, it can be visualized as something even simpler. The original Star Trek TV series with its large production budget was a guide to many future science fiction designers. The multitude of flashing lights on extensive consoles, each a button or a switch. This left a feeling of importance to the actor using it. When it came time for the reboot of the series 20 years later in 1987, the budget to build the similar looking hand wired flashing light button consoles was not there. The production designer of the series Michael Okuda decided to go with a much less expensive console method. Simply put a color film with a printed interface on a table and have lighting underneath it for illumination. On a smooth surface this created the illusion of an interface without physical buttons, much like our current touch screens. It became the icon for the interface technology of the whole series and resonated through many follow-up versions of the series. The buttons of science fiction had moved from pushing a door to pulling a lever to nudging a buttonless button. </p>
  
  <p>
The past years have been very touch-screen heavy for many interface fields, most notably mobile devices such as phones and laptops. But while modern science fiction imagery shows us a future filled with floating touch based interfaces and other screens lacking in physical buttons, the Software usability Research Laboratory at Wichita State University has done extensive research on the subject of touchscreen typing versus physical keyboard typing, and has concluded that while we interface with our computers using our hands and more importantly our fingers for typing, a physical keyboard with its tactile feedback will stand over touchscreens. <a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote"> </a> Shedroff asks in his book if we will make a full circle back to physical levers as our hands are made to interact with levers and buttons rather than touchscreens, but I think looking back at science fiction pushes us out of predictable loops. Tactus Technology is developing a surface that can mold its screen to have buttons of any kind or layout overlaying a touchscreen. This further blurs the line between what is a physical button and what our fingers can interface with. <a href="#fn:9" rel="footnote"> </a>
</p>
  
  <h3 id="22">2.2 Capitalized green text</h3>
  
  <p>As with depiction of space travel, the early years of computer interfaces in movies relied heavily on imagination. One of the earliest 3D computer rendered interfaces in science fiction cinema was in 1977 Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. In the scene the pilots are shown a 3D representation of the Death Star trenches composed of vertex points and lines. While the way it was produced was using virtual world coordinates and programming with visual output only existing after a tedious programming effort, the outcome shown is very similar to how current 3D industry has adopted the making of 3D models for CAD application, 3D printing, game character development and even still visual effects in movies. This was mainly contributed by Edwin Catmull who in the 70s was pioneering the efforts to develop computer generated imagery.  <a href="#fn:10" rel="footnote"> </a>
   </p>
  
  <p>
While there are a multitude of examples towards visualizations in early science fiction movies, they can be divided into two main categories. Text based interfaces and graphical user interfaces. There is not much chronological effect to them. They have been overlapping since eithers conception, but the mood and feel they produce has been significantly different. </p>
  
  <p>
Text based interfaces also referred to as Command-Line Interfaces are still with us today making the use of them in early science fiction cinema not very utopian. We use them for programming, website building and in-depth interaction with our computers even though most users might never have opened a Command-Line Interface on their computer. The main change between the look of prior text based interfaces and the modern ones is mainly contributed to the resolution of the screens and the color coding of the interface tags. Early text interfaces while complex and difficult to learn had a very distinctive look to them. The low resolution capitalized sans serif shapes as type, the mono colored screens, the mechanical way of typing and feel of the keyboards. In Ridley Scott's 1979 movie Alien, the main spaceship has a number of futuristic aspects about it, but the main interface with the spaceship crews commanders is through a computer that even at the time the movie was made, felt almost archaic. This mainframe style computer that requires slow and heavy single key press typing sets an atmosphere matching that of the relation between the inhabitants of the spaceship and the alien aboard. In this scenario a more futuristic interface would have not been suitable to show the very in moment struggle of the crew. The interface matched the steady almost ticking like environment.
Text based interfaces are also used in conjunction with hacker culture. Most famously referenced by movies like 1999 the Matrix, 2001 Swordfish or 2006 Firewall. Often the text based interfaces in these movies are either not the focus of the scene and as such are left ambiguous and out of focus or they are an integral part of the character development showing the advanced knowledge of a character. Command-Line interfaces are also used to bring a certain level of nostalgia to an environment as it represents the most basic and fundamental beginnings of the computer interface. An example of this is the 2010 movie TRON: Legacy where the main character uses an old dust covered computer that while functioning as a touch-screen has the visuals of a 80s CRT monitor. </p>
  
  <p>
The 1990s brought on the internet adoption and with it the need to describe computer file structures, networks or data in general. And while many descriptions of them used metaphors like city, web, window, doorway, science fiction movies had to describe them visually. This brought on a myriad of interfaces trying to portray computer based networks, data structures or accessing files by hacking. One of the more notorious ones are 1995 Hackers and Johnny Mnemonic. Hackers visualizes the internet as a spatial layered three dimensional array of containers where data is moved on an object basis. Visual symbols such as worms, rabbits and skyscrapers are covering the users' interfaces to portray data and by doing so the information on screen becomes unreadable. Johnny Mnemonic takes a more futuristic approach as a user wearing a virtual headset almost identical to current Oculus Rift or Sony Morpheus goggles, sees a spatial representation of data and the internet as a literal cityscape that can be navigated with gestures. The way these two movies visualize the internet and display data are extremely over the top and unpractical, but there is logic behind them. In 1994, one year prior to these two films, Muriel Cooper a digital designer and researcher presented her groups work done at the MIT Media Lab at a TED5 conference in Monterey, California. What she and her group worked on was developing a way to visualize typography in three dimensional space. She called this research "Designing an information landscape in time and space". During the talk she presented a number of demos put together to show how typography could function in endless space and how moving through data could be done in a more engaging way. It was a revolutionary moment as the trend for interface design at that time was solely based on the desktop metaphor with overlapping opaque rectangles. What Cooper visualized was a way to stack information and show hierarchy, navigate through it and see data horizons of possible headings. Scale through containers of filterable topics, visualize data as graphs and amounts without the need to swap applications. This was a groundbreaking way to treat typography on the computer. Text no longer had to be treated as pixels parallel to the screen. Just as street signs direct our stare by pointing the way, so too did Coopers way of displaying data give us direction for navigation. While mainstream acceptance of this type of navigation has not been attempted, many science fiction films noted Coopers visuals for their own idea of the futuristic interface, thus giving hope to at least a partial adaptation of her demo in actual usable form.
</p>
  
  <h3 id="23">2.3 GUI</h3>
  <p>With the wide adaptation of office computers in the late 80s the cumbersome command-line interface had to be simplified. While much of the advancements in home computing interface has been given to Apple with their Macintosh line of computers, the actual revolution of an interface came from XEROX Palo Alto Research Center (PARC). Many science fiction movies before had treated the computer screen interface with layout elements and buttons, but at PARC they were the first to develop the desktop related Graphical User Interface (GUI) that we still are accustomed to today. <a href="#fn:11" rel="footnote"> </a> The imagery they produced was not covered in eye candy as it is nowadays but it was a strong foundation to build on, one that has not yet been surpassed.  </p>
  
  <p>
Science fiction graphical user interfaces can be looked at from the visual aspect such as its shape, colors, use of typography and image, but also from the content they were made to show be it maps, infographics, or specific actions. Science fiction cinema has been hard at work to create futuristic displays that do not fit our standards. Shape wise that has accounted for non-rectangular screens and bent display surfaces. But while movies such as 2002 Men in Black 2 or 1999 Star Wars 1: The Phantom Menace showed us irregular displays, circular displays and ultra-high definition displays, with such strong presence in our movie catalogue, it didn't take more than a decade for research labs to develop such displays and by now we can have them in our homes or on our wrists. Latest examples of this would be the myriad of inwards curved televisions and outwards curved smartwatches. Even though science fiction used curved displays as a gimmick to differentiate themselves from standards, this technology is said to be of actual benefit for screen users. Most notable by curving displays the image is from every angle the same distance from the users' eyes. This is said to reduce eyestrain on long uses.  <a href="#fn:12" rel="footnote"> </a> </p>
  
  <p>
In my mind a less practical technology introduced by science fiction and in development currently is transparent displays. It is the wild idea that a screen should not have a background, but rather only display brightness overlaid on a see-through surface. While this interfacing method has become overly popular mainly after the turn of the millennia as seen in movies like 2000 Mission to mars, 2002 Minority Report or even 2009 Avatar, it was first imagined in H.G. Wells's science fiction book "The Shape of Things to Come" published in 1933. In the movie adaptation of the book released in 1936 the imagery clearly shows a faint projection on transparent glass with the cast moving behind it. In the scene a girl remarks "They keep on inventing new things, don't they? And making life lovelier and lovelier." I can see the reason for using it in science fiction film. When filmed from behind the screen it gives the ability to show the actors face and reaction to the data being shown on the display while keeping the rest of the interface ambiguous as it is horizontally flipped and unclear anyways. In the real world though on a user's work desk, such a display would simply confuse the eye with focusing on the display itself, but there are uses for this type of technology. One part of this technology that has been implemented to mimic a transparent display is in Head up Displays (HUD). First in military use for example in fighter jets where it shows altitude and tracking information and later also in commercial cars where it displays speed or navigation. Unlike the desktop environment pictured in science fiction movies, in the case of vehicle HUDs, as it is not the main focus during driving it works as a helpful guide rather than a distraction. <a href="#fn:13" rel="footnote"> </a> </p>
  
  <p>
 Typography and color play a large part in the way of defining an interfaces usefulness and application. In his book Shedroff generated a color scheme of science fiction cinema, bringing out the most used tones by year. With certain deviations in 1989, 1991 and the mid-2000s, the irrefutable color of science fiction displays is a mix of blue. One of the men behind many of the looks and feels of modern science fiction interfaces is Mark Coleran, an interface designer often commissioned to develop interfaces for television series, video games and Hollywood movies. Some of his most notable work are for films such as 2006 Children of Men and 2005 The Island. In his blog he brings out four reasons he believes science fiction has adopted the color blue for its identity, the first being RGB displays. He says film set lighting, especially in older films, has always been very bright. This can wash out the details presented on the screen in focus. Using a single main color from the red green blue displays gives it a stronger emphasize. And as green is associated often with past technologies like the command-line interfaces of the 70s and red has a predefined danger and military reference, what was left was blue. A more unconscious reason is that screens on film have a tendency to look bluish. This can be balanced with preemptively making a screen look warmer while filming or fixing it with color grading in post-production. The last two reasons Coleran brings out have to do with people's color-vision. This refers to the color blue being the first color we process in our brains as it has the shortest wavelength, making it more preferable by most people. And with decades of blue color already as the key tone in interfaces, viewers can use the color as a familiar link on an otherwise exotic display technology.  <a href="#fn:14" rel="footnote"> </a> </p>
  
  <p>
Content itself on displays is usually in the form of typography or infographics. In the case of the latter, it has become the goal to show emphasize rather than actual information or data. This is especially apparent in newer movies like 2009 Avatar, 2014 Guardians of the Galaxy and most of the Ironman films where many displays have simply become windows to play an elaborate animation on rather than show an imaginative futuristic functional application. Looking at older science fiction films and the information they displayed on their screen, it was more about what the designers imagined a computer or device could do and how the people interfacing with it would use it and benefit from it. This can be seen many times in Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey. The tablets shown angled on tables set a feeling for the environment as a casual locale while being useful at carrying on the plot of the movie. With technology catching up on many science fictions greatest devices, the relation between the content and device has blurred to the point where futuristic interfaces have simply become a .mov file. </p>

Typeset in The Future is a website blog dedicated to looking into typography presented in iconic science fiction films, be it the title sequence, interfaces and displays, buttons, labels or even logos. In their articles they dissect the most prominent scenes in science fiction history and look at what the set designers have said with their use of typography. Unfortunately what they discovered is that rarely is there any deviation from already set 20th century typography norms. The most used fonts in science fiction films are considered to be Microgamma, Eurostyle and Helvetica, with 7-segment and OCR A / B as scene specific extras. This is a strange aspect, as looking into the typographic developments in the last few century alone would give hope to this progress continuing in the 21st century and further. But what we are treated with is the same norms as today. Dave Addey, one of the writers on Typeset in The Future suggests that this could simply be a balancing element. With many components of a science fiction scene already being wildly futuristic and bizarre, typography is the piece that can still make it recognizable to the viewers. <a href="#fn:15" rel="footnote"> </a> Another reason for keeping the typography so clean and recognizable could be the idea of Chekhof's gun. This is the principle that every element in a narration needs a purpose and cannot be replaced. In the case of typography in science fiction films, the Chekhof's gun is the red large bold text on a door that read "CAUTION, EXPLOSIVE BOLTS". <a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote"> </a> The unsurprising climax being that at one point during the movie the explosive bolts will then explode. As the average shot lengths of action sequences is around 2-3 seconds per shot, the time viewers have to read any text is very limited. The same reason counts for the simplicity of typography displayed on screens. While some interfaces in science fiction keep the information on them ambiguous as it is not vital to the plot, when there is a message to be told by a screen, it is sized almost from edge to edge. Freezing the film and judging the interface as a still image counts for a very disappointing experience as the usability of the interface can seem close to useless except to display that one word message. This leads to less typographic excitement on the side of movie interfaces but designers try to make up for it by playing with the type of title sequences. Two notable ones being Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and Ridley Scott's Alien. Kubrick's film starts with a calm camera tilt across space with the title sequence popping up in Gill Sans, having its O letters exchanged for the almost perfectly circular zeros. Alien however starts with a 90 second long eyrie fade in of lines that eventually spell out the movie title. While typography plays a very specific plot role in the midst of a film, it is exciting to see designers being able to make something typographically memorable for science fiction movies in the form of title sequences.
